## Install plugchain
This guide will install the plugchaind entry point on the system, you can join as a full node or validator
#### Install build requirements
- On Centos this can be done with the following:
```
yum install make gcc git
```
#### install Golang
-  verison (>=1.16)
- [golang version](https://studygolang.com/dl)
- The v1.16.4 version downloaded in this tutorial.
```sh
wget https://studygolang.com/dl/golang/go1.16.4.linux-amd64.tar.gz
```
```sh
rm -rf /usr/local/go && tar -C /usr/local -zxf go1.16.4.linux-amd64.tar.gz
```
```
export PATH=$PATH:/usr/local/go/bin 
```
```
mkdir -p $HOME/go/bin
echo "export PATH=$PATH:$(go env GOPATH)/bin" >> ~/.bash_profile
echo "export GOPATH=$HOME/go" >> ~/.bash_profile
```

```
source ~/.bash_profile
go version
```
1.  Install the latest version of plugchain and clone the code from the warehouse
```
git clone https://github.com/oracleNetworkProtocol/plugchain.git
```
> If cloning the warehouse is slow or unresponsive, you can replace the clone address `github.com` with a domestic mirror. The known domestic mirrors are `github.com.cnpmjs.org` and `git.sdut.me/`

2.  Open gomodule and set terminal GOPROXY
```
go env -w GO111MODULE=on
export GOPROXY=https://goproxy.io,direct
```
#### Compile the binary file
```shell
cd plugchain && make install
```
##### The main branch code is compiled by default, and fixed version compilation can be selected, for example:
> `cd plugchaind && git checkout v0.2.0 && make install`

3. After the installation is complete, there will be a plugchaind binary file, you can verify whether it takes effect
```
plugchaind version
```
Confirm that the command prints the installed version of Go.


#### To run as a full node or a validator node, please copy the genesis file to your own data directory first
- Initialize your own node
```
plugchaind init mycustomMoniker --chain-id plugchain
```

- Set the data directory and initialize the default directory to ~/.plugchain. If you want to change it, please delete the default and reinitialize your node. Point to --home, `plugchaind init mycustomMoniker --home node --chain-id plugchain`

```shell
APPHOME="~/.plugchain"
```
- Generate your own account
```
plugchaind keys add mywallet
```
- Get the testnet genesis file
::: warning
The mainnet is being prepared. Join [Testnet](../../../testnet/README.md), the plugchain team warmly welcomes like-minded comrades...
:::
```
wget https://github.com/oracleNetworkProtocol/plugchain/tree/main/genesis.json
```
- Overwrite genesis file
```
mv -f genesis.json $APPHOME/config/
```
- Need to add the normal seed node to $APPHOME/config/config.toml, otherwise the node will not work normally 
- #TODO


- Your full node saves unconfirmed transactions in its memory pool. To prevent spam, it is best to set a minimum gas price that a transaction must meet in order to be accepted in your node's memory pool. This parameter `min-gas-prices` can be set in the following file $APPHOME/config/app.toml.

- Run `plugchaind start` to participate in the project
